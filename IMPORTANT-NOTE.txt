My version of startpage.html is only written so far to work on mobile devices only. 
I am currently in the process of writing the media queries and extra markup for larger
screen sizes. 

Also just to add, I did this just for the fun of it. I've been studying and practicing web development 
and design for some years now as well as other programming languages so I figured I'd go on github 
and look for small projects like this one to revise and make my own version of for the practice and 
experience. Going off of a project that is already started gives me an idea of how it will be to have
to work with content given to me by clients rather than only designing things on my own. If you don't
use it it's cool, but I did want to at least show you(the craetor/s) what I designed.

Thnx :P
