This version of startpage.html is written inside of index.html and it's css is in index.css. This was meant to preserve the original to use as a reference.
The media queries for larger screens are inside of 'css/responsive.css'

I [ctrl + A'd] the contents of startpage.html and pasted it into index.html and then built off of that 
rather than writing it completely from scratch.

I tried to keep the simplistic style of the original but interpreted in my own way. 
I thought the colors that the author\s originally had were kind of cool so I decided
to keep them and just switch up the background color. I always love dark ui's personally although 
the way the original site looks is great already. 

Also just to add, I did this just for the fun of it. I've been studying and practicing web development 
and design for some years now as well as other programming languages so I figured I'd go on github 
and look for small projects like this one to revise and make my own version of for the practice and 
experience. Going off of a project that is already started gives me an idea of how it will be to have
to work with content given to me by clients rather than only designing things on my own.
So I appreciate it everyone feel free to msg me anytime day or night.

Thnx :P
